## Notes

### P1 - Critical Architecture Decisions  
- **Real-time Performance**: Must achieve <200ms message delivery via Socket.IO
- **Voice Quality**: Discord-level WebRTC implementation is our key differentiator
- **Database Strategy**: PostgreSQL with 10 core tables optimized for messaging workloads ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  - All 10 tables created: users, workspaces, workspace_members, channels, channel_members, messages, emojis, message_reactions, huddles, huddle_participants
  - Comprehensive indexes for performance (18 indexes across all tables)
  - Full relational setup with foreign keys and cascade deletions
  - Seed data: 34 default emojis, test users, workspace, channels ready for testing

### P2 - Development Workflow  
- TDD approach for all backend endpoints
- Component isolation with proper error boundaries
- API-first development to enable parallel frontend/backend work
- ✅ Frontend foundation complete: Next.js 15 + Tailwind v4 + TypeScript + comprehensive design system
- Modern Slack-like UI with workspace switching, channel navigation, real-time messaging interface ready

### P3 - Current Context
- Building Slack competitor with messaging, huddles, and emojis
- Target: Teams seeking Discord voice quality + Slack productivity
- Tech stack: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Socket.IO + PostgreSQL + WebRTC

## Step 6 Completion Summary

✅ **Backend Plan**: 9 comprehensive tickets covering database setup, authentication, messaging system, huddles, emojis, and security infrastructure. Estimated 6 weeks for completion.

✅ **Frontend Plan**: 15 detailed tickets covering component library, authentication UI, workspace management, real-time messaging, huddle controls, and performance optimization. Estimated 8 weeks for completion.

✅ **Integration Plan**: 10 strategic tickets covering OAuth, email services, file storage, WebRTC signaling, push notifications, Slack migration, third-party apps, and analytics. Estimated 8 weeks for completion.

**Total Project Timeline**: ~12-14 weeks with parallel development streams

**Key Development Phases**:
1. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-2): Database, auth, component library, monitoring
2. **Core Features** (Weeks 3-6): Messaging, real-time updates, workspace management  
3. **Advanced Features** (Weeks 7-10): Huddles, integrations, file storage
4. **Polish & Launch** (Weeks 11-14): Performance optimization, PWA features, testing

### Step 9 Integration Progress (MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH! 🎉)
- [x] **Fixed Backend Health Endpoint** - Updated to return proper `{success: true, data: {...}}` format
- [x] **Backend API Server** - Running successfully with all endpoints
- [x] **Frontend API Proxy** - Working correctly through `/api/proxy/*` routes  
- [x] **Database Connection** - PostgreSQL connected with test users (admin@slackclone.dev exists)
- [x] **Direct Backend Login Test** - curl test shows authentication working perfectly
- [x] **Frontend-Backend Communication** - Health check now shows "✅ Backend connection successful!"

### Current Issue: Login Flow Not Completing
- Backend `/api/auth/login` returns proper JWT token when tested directly with curl
- Frontend makes successful health check requests
- But login form submission doesn't seem to make network requests  
- May need to standardize all backend endpoint response formats

### Next Priority Actions:
- [ ] Fix all backend endpoints to use consistent `{success: true, data: {...}}` format
- [ ] Test complete login flow end-to-end
- [ ] Implement real-time features (Socket.IO)
- [ ] Add voice huddles (WebRTC)
