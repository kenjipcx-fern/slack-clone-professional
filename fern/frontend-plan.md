## Component Architecture Patterns

### Container vs Presentation Components
```typescript
// Container Component (logic)
const MessageListContainer = () => {
  const { messages, loading, error } = useMessages();
  return <MessageList messages={messages} loading={loading} />;
};

// Presentation Component (UI)
const MessageList = ({ messages, loading }: Props) => {
  return <div>{/* UI only */}</div>;
};
```

### Custom Hooks for Reusability
```typescript
// useSocket.ts - WebSocket management
// useAuth.ts - Authentication state
// useNotifications.ts - Notification system
// useHuddle.ts - WebRTC huddle management
```

### Error Boundaries
```typescript
// Global error boundary for unhandled errors
// Component-specific error boundaries
// API error handling with toast notifications
```
